# A webserver implemented in AWK. 
Start it with `awk -f http.awk`. Edit the port and http dir by changing the values at line 2 and 4.

## Why?
Why not?

## How?
The GNU implementation of awk (gawk) has builtin tcp and udp networking support. Opening a socket or listening on one is fairly trivial.
`HttpService |& getline line` creates a bidirectional pipe that can be read from or written to. The pipe is a tcp connection because of the way the path is constructed. Since the HTTP protocol is old it is easy to handroll.
Simply check if something is a GET request and serve the file that is asked for. `realpath` is used to prevent directory escaping.
